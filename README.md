Using backtracking algorithm, we will try to solve Sudoku problem. When some cell is filled with a digit, it checks whether it is valid or not. When it is not valid, it checks for other numbers. If all numbers are checked from 1-9, and no valid digit found to place, it backtracks to previous option.
